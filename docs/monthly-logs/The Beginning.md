## Tasks Completed
- [ ] Configured NeoVim
- [ ] Setup Documentation template and folder structure
- [ ] Linked Documentation from Obsidian to Repository using `ln -s`


## Challenges / Roadblocks
- Using Templater plugin. Configured by watching You-Tube video. Automated 
  templates are now created once you add a new note to folder.

## Learnings / Notes
- NeoVim has a somewhat steep learning curve by the looks of it but I cannot 
  wait to learn the workflow.
- Found out you can link with `ln -s` 
- Learned that `vimtutor` is something I can use to learn in terminal.
- Having a look at ESP32 DevKitC V4 Board info.
